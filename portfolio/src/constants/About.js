    "bio": "Greetings! My name is Ana Carrillo and I'm a full-stack web developer with a background in sales and business management. Currently seeking new opportunities in the southeast (GA, VA, TN for starters). \n\nEver since I had my first computer science class in high school, software development has been my passion. I still remember sitting in front of a Dell Inspiron 8500 laptop(2003), making it print “Hello, World!” and trying out everything I had learned from Computer Science class such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I was amazed by what I could do so, I decided to go to Georgia State after High School but for financial reasons, I stopped in my second year. However, my passion, my obsession, and my faith in me to become a Web Developer never died. \n\nLater the years, I found Lambda School, an academy that invests in its students first. Here I've found more than just learning languages and solving algorithms, I have learned to pair-program, to problem-solve as a team, to get rid of my ego and ask for help to Senior Developers ( especially when I can’t find resources from Mr. Google ). \n\nNow, in industry, this passion remains with me. There's certainly yet more to learn, more to debug, and more to build, And for this, I am grateful."
