    "bio": "My name is Ana Carrillo and I'm a full-stack web developer with a background in sales and business management. Currently seeking new opportunities in the southeast (GA, VA, TN for starters). I enjoy exploring green mountains and beautiful long trails. \n\nEver since I had my first Computer Science class in high school, I started to develop affection for software development. I still remember sitting in front of a Dell Inspiron 8500 laptop(2003), making it print “Hello, World!” and trying out everything I had studied class such as making a website dynamic by applying Javascript. Amazed by what I could do, I decided to go to Georgia State after High School but for financial reasons, I stopped in my second year. However, my passion and confidence to be a great Web Developer never died. \n\nLater the years, I discovered Lambda School, an academy that invests in its students first. Here I've learned more than just learning languages and solving algorithms, I have learned to pair-program, to problem-solve as a team, to get rid of my ego and ask for help ( primarily when I can’t find resources from Mr. Google ). \n\nNow, in industry, this passion remains with me. There's unquestionably more to discover, more to debug, and more to build, And for this, I am grateful."
